# Week 3 README

## Biological Computing in R Practice
## Discription
This is a union R learning and practicing database, which contains r scripts, input data or files and some of the output files.
There are 4 directories including code, data, result and sandbox. 
- Code contains all of the r scripts.
- Data contains 6 csv files and 2 RData files downloaded from [CMEECourse website](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/tree/master/content/data). 
- Result only contains a .gitignore file.
- Sandbox contains test files to practice command usage.

## Languages
R

## Dependencies
maps, ggplot2, tidyvere, dplyr

## Installation
Please download all of the files in a suitable directory.

## Project Structure and Usage: 
**Please remember to run these shell scripts in code directory.**
### Code
- DataWrang.R: Wrangling the Pound Hill Dataset
- DataWrangTidy.R: use tidyverse package command to Wrangle the Pound Hill Dataset
- GPDD_Data.R: using the maps package in R to do mapping with Global Population Dynamics Database(GPDD)
- Girko.Rï¼š draw the results of a simulation displaying Girko's circular law
- MyBars.R: use ggplot geom_text to annotate a plot
- PP_Dists.R: draw and save 3 graphics relatively for distribution of log(Predator mass), log(Prey mass) and the size ratio of Prey mass over Predator mass, containing subplots by Type.of.feeding.interaction
- PP_Regress.R: draw and save a pdf file showing linear regression of 18 subsets (all available Feeding Type * Predator life stage combination) of the data and calculate regression results exported to a formatted table in csv
- R_conditionals.R: some examples of functions with conditionals
- Ricker.R: a script shows Ricker model which is a classic discrete population model
- SQLinR.R: R can also also be used to access, update and manage databases, use SQLite to build, manipulate, and access databases
- TAutoCorr.R: autocorrelation in weather, answering whether temperatures of one year are significantly correlated with the next year, across years in a given location
- TAutoCorr.tex: a latex file illustrating TAutoCorr.R results
- TreeHeight.R: This script reads a csv file containing trees' species, distance and angle, calculates all of the trees' height, then append heights to the origin csv file as a new csv file stored in ../result
- Vectorize1.R: an example illustrating that vectorization can optimize code computational efficiency and make code more concise, easy to read, less prone
- Vectorize2.R: Runs the stochastic Ricker equation with gaussian fluctuations in non-vectorization way and vectorization way
- apply1.R: use apply to vectorize code, applying the same function to rows/columns of a matrix
- apply2.R: use apply to define your own functions
- basic_io.R: A simple script to illustrate R input-output.
- boilerplate.R: A boilerplate R script
- break.R: a control flow tool, break, is useful to break out of loops when some condition is met
- browse.R: use browser() to debug script, inserting a breakpoint in code and then stepping throuth code
- control_flow.R: control flow tools in R including if, then, else and for and while loops
- next.R: a control flow tool, next, is used to skip to next iteration of a loop
- plotLin.R: mathematical annotation on a axis and in the plot area
- preallocate.R: an example shows pre-allocate a vector can make results faster
- sample.R: an example of vectorization involving lapply and sapply
- try.R: use try keyword to catch the error and keep going instead of having R throw you out

### Data
- EcolArchives-E089-51-D1.csv: import file of PP_Dists.R and PP_Regress.R
- GPDDFiltered.RData: import file of GPDD_Data.R			
- KeyWestAnnualMeanTemperature.RData: import file of TAutoCorr.R
- PoundHillData.csv: import file of DataWrang.R and DataWrangTidy.R
- PoundHillMetaData.csv: import file of DataWrang.R and DataWrangTidy.R
- Resource.csv: import file of SQLinR.R
- Results.txt: import file of MyBars.R
- trees.csv: import file of TreeHeight.R

### Result
An empty directory as origin version only with a .gitignore.

### Sandbox
There is only a pdf file for TAutoCorr.tex
