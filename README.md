## Coding and Data Abalysis Practices in Ecology and Evolution
## Discription
This is a union of coding and data analysis practices in the realm of life science. These are the exercises in Computational Methods in Ecology and Evolution (CMEE) Master Program fall semester based on Imperial College London, Silwood Park.

## Languages
Shell, LaTeX, Python, R

## Dependencies
LaTeX packeges: graphicx, caption, lineno, natbib\\
R packages: reshape2, minpack.lm, ggplot2, maps, tidyvere, dplyr, broom\\

## Installation
Please download all of the files in a suitable directory.

## Project Structure and Usage: 
This project is divided into several weeks. Each week focuses on a theme. Every directory shares the same structure, including 4 sub-directories, code, data, result and sandbox. Details of scripts usage please read README.md in every directory separately.
- Week1: Unix, Shell and LaTeX practice
- Week2: biological computing in Python I practice
- Week3: biological computing, data analysis and visualization in R practice
- Week7: biological computing in Python II practice
- miniproject: computational biology techniques concrete exercise
