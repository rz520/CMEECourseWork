# Week 2 README

## Biological Computing in Python I Practice
## Discription
This is a union Python learning and practicing database, which contains python scripts, input data or files and some of the output files.
There are 4 directories including code, data, result and sandbox. 
- Code contains all of the python scripts.
- Data contains a csv files downloaded from [CMEECourse website](https://github.com/mhasoba/TheMulQuaBio/tree/master/content/data). There is also an output file after dealing with data files. Furthermore, there are 3 other files as default input files of some python scripts in code directory.
- Result only contains a .gitignore file.
- Sandbox contains test files to practice command usage.

## Languages
Python

## Dependencies
None

## Installation
Please download all of the files in a suitable directory.

## Project Structure and Usage: 
**Please remember to run these shell scripts in code directory.**
### Code
- align_seqs.py: Align 2 seqs and find the best matched alignment. The input files should be 2 fasta files. The best alignment will be stored in ../result/seq_align_fasta.txt
- basic_csv.py: Some practices on basic commands in csv package to manipulate CSV file
- basic_io1.py: Import data in python practice
- basic_io2.py: Export data in python practice
- basic_io3.py: Pickle practice on saving an object for later use
- boilerplate.py: An example python program structure
- cfexercises1.py: Some functions exemplifying the use of conditionals allowing fine-grained control over the function's operations
- cfexercises2.py: Some exemples show the use of loops and conditionals combined
- control_flow.py: Some functions exemplifying the use of control statements
- debugme.py: An example shows how to debug in python
- dictionary.py: This python script populates a dictionary 'taxa_dic' derived from a list 'taxa', mapping order names to sets of taxa
- lc1.py: This python script shows comprehensions and conventional loops usages when creating lists from a tuple
- lc2.py: This python script is another practice on comprehension and conventional loops
- loops.py: For loops and while loops practices in python
- oaks.py: Loops and comprehensions examples in finding oak trees from a list of species
- scope.py: Some examples explaining variable scope in python
- sysargv.py: An example shows what is sys.argv and how to use it
- test_control_flow.py: Using doctest to run embedded tests on some functions exemplifying the use of control statements
- tuple.py: This is a practice about printing every singel element in a tuple of tuples on a seperate line
- using_name.py: Explain the last part of python program "if _name__ == '_main__'" meaning 

### Data
- Input files: testcsv.csv, examplefasta.csv, seq1.fasta, seq2.fasta
- Output files: bodymass.csv

### Result
An empty directory as origin version only with a .gitignore.

### Sandbox
All of these directories and files are just used for testing command or scripts, usually nonsense.
