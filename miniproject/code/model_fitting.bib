abstract = "Several models which describe population growth and mortality are evaluated and discussed using data from a single cohort population of Sparus aurata. This fish is commonly used in aquaculture in Mediterranean countries. The decision about which growth model to use is important, as most ecological models deal with transfer of energy or matter along the trophic chain. Growth can be constant or change during development periods. Although initial and final weights estimated with different models may be similar, growth curves as well as the total amount of energy or matter consumed over time may vary considerably during the growth period. It is suggested that the Gompertz or the parabolic growth models seem to be more appropriate for the description of young fish growth. For older fish the von Bertalanffy equation or some modified form adjusted to seasonal change is preferable."

abstract = {The temperature dependence of highly conserved subcellular metabolic systems affects ecological patterns and processes across scales, from organisms to ecosystems. Population density at carrying capacity plays an important role in evolutionary processes, biodiversity, and ecosystem function, yet how it varies with temperature-dependent metabolism remains unclear. Though the exponential effect of temperature on intrinsic population growth rate, r, is well known, we still lack clear evidence that population density at carrying capacity, K, declines with increasing per capita metabolic rate, as predicted by the metabolic theory of ecology (MTE). We experimentally tested whether temperature effects on photosynthesis propagate directly to population carrying capacity in a model species, the mobile phytoplankton Tetraselmis tetrahele. After maintaining populations at a fixed resource supply and fixed temperatures for 43 days, we found that carrying capacity declined with increasing temperature. This decline was predicted quantitatively when models included temperature-dependent metabolic rates and temperature-associated body-size shifts. Our results demonstrate that warming reduces carrying capacity and that temperature effects on body size and metabolic rate interact to determine how temperature affects population dynamics. These findings bolster efforts to relate metabolic temperature dependence to population and ecosystem patterns via MTE.},

Our analysis of the model clearly shows the existence of thresholds for mosquito repellent efficacy and its utilization rate in the human population with respect to the elimination of mosquito-borne diseases. Further, the results imply that the suppression of mosquito-borne diseases becomes more difficult when the mosquitoes’ distribution is biased to a greater extent around the human population.},

abstract = "Carrying capacity estimations for any population of organisms is made in order to determine the maximum population densities that could result under set environmental conditions. Carrying capacity (K) is often used in terrestrial ecosystems to estimate potential plant densities (yields) related to the availability of resources. Here we wanted to see whether a similar concept could be applied to the plants of the ocean: Phytoplankton. Using the Helgoland Roads Time Series data sets, the main focus was on those which control phytoplankton growth in the ocean. We aimed to estimate K and determine whether K is static or variable, evaluated the relationship of phytoplankton K with higher trophic levels. We also provided a guideline to use K as ecosystem management tool. Algorithms were developed to estimate the K based on each controlling factor. A pair-wise comparison matrix was used for weighting the controlling factors and then to integrate the estimated K based on controlling factors to obtain an overall K. Long-term intra-annual and inter-annual mean K were estimated 10.13 × 107 cells m−3 and 1.30 × 108 cells m−3, respectively. Our analyses suggest that K should not be considered as a static permanent value. This is because it is driven by overall environmental conditions and is subject to change when overall environment change. We linked the estimated K to pelagic fisheries data of the North Sea and found that phytoplankton K is correlated with the pelagic fisheries of this area. Our overall conclusion is that phytoplankton K is a viable concept and could be utilized as a valuable management tool."

abstract = {Eco-evolutionary dynamics occur when ecological change influences evolutionary change (eco-to-evo) and when evolutionary change influences ecological change (evo-to-eco), both on contemporary time scales. Fishes, amphibians, and reptiles have played important roles as study animals in the empirical study and exploration of these dynamics. We suggest that this primacy stems in part from the sweet-spot that many species of fishes, amphibians, and reptiles occupy on the continuum from experimental convenience to ecological importance, as well as on the particular organismal properties that they share, including indeterminate growth and ectothermy. Yet our overall understanding of eco-evolutionary dynamics remains very limited. In the hope of reducing this information gap, the present symposium proceedings include 12 contributions that speak directly to three critical topics in eco-evolutionary dynamics: the role of human influences, constraints and alternatives, and the context dependence of eco-evolutionary dynamics

abstract = "Recently, researchers in several areas of ecology and evolution have begun to change the way in which they analyze data and make biological inferences. Rather than the traditional null hypothesis testing approach, they have adopted an approach called model selection, in which several competing hypotheses are simultaneously confronted with data. Model selection can be used to identify a single best model, thus lending support to one particular hypothesis, or it can be used to make inferences based on weighted support from a complete set of competing models. Model selection is widely accepted and well developed in certain fields, most notably in molecular systematics and mark–recapture analysis. However, it is now gaining support in several other areas, from molecular evolution to landscape ecology. Here, we outline the steps of model selection and highlight several ways that it is now being implemented. By adopting this approach, researchers in ecology and evolution will find a valuable alternative to traditional null hypothesis testing, especially when more than one hypothesis is plausible."

abstract = {Summary Ecologists often use nonlinear fitting techniques to estimate the parameters of complex ecological models, with attendant frustration. This paper compares three open-source model fitting tools and discusses general strategies for defining and fitting models. R is convenient and (relatively) easy to learn, AD Model Builder is fast and robust but comes with a steep learning curve, while BUGS provides the greatest flexibility at the price of speed. Our model-fitting suggestions range from general cultural advice (where possible, use the tools and models that are most common in your subfield) to specific suggestions about how to change the mathematical description of models to make them more amenable to parameter estimation. A companion web site (https://groups.nceas.ucsb.edu/non-linear-modeling/projects) presents detailed examples of application of the three tools to a variety of typical ecological estimation problems; each example links both to a detailed project report and to full source code and data.},

abstract = {During the last decade, individual-based modelling (IbM) has proven to be a valuable tool for modelling and studying microbial dynamics. As each individual is considered as an independent entity with its own characteristics, IbM enables the study of microbial dynamics and the inherent variability and heterogeneity. IbM simulations and (single-cell) experimental research form the basis to unravel individual cell characteristics underlying population dynamics. In this study, the IbM framework MICRODIMS, i.e., MICRObial Dynamics Individual-based Model/Simulator, is used to investigate the system dynamics (with respect to the model and the system modelled). First, the impact of the time resolution on the simulation accuracy is discussed. Second, the effect of the inoculum state and size on emerging individual dynamics, such as individual mass, individual age and individual generation time distribution dynamics, is studied. The distributions of individual characteristics are more informative during the lag phase and the transition to the exponential growth phase than during the exponential phase. The first generation time distributions are strongly influenced by the inoculum state. All inocula with a pronounced heterogeneity, except the inocula starting from a uniform distribution, exhibit commonly observed microbial behaviour, like a more spread first generation time distribution compared to following generations and a fast stabilisation of biomass and age distributions.},

abstract = {The use of primary mathematical models with curve fitting software is dramatically changing quantitative food microbiology. The two most widely used primary growth models are the Baranyi and Gompertz models. A three-phase linear model was developed to determine how well growth curves could be described using a simpler model. The model divides bacterial growth curves into three phases: the lag and stationary phases where the specific growth rate is zero (gm=0), and the exponential phase where the logarithm of the bacterial population increases linearly with time (gm=constant). The model has four parameters: No(Log8of initial population density), NMAX(Log8of final population density), tLAG(time when lag phase ends), and tMAX(time when exponential phase ends). A comparison of the linear model was made against the Baranyi and Gompertz models, using established growth data forEscherichia coli0157:H7. The growth curves predicted by the three models showed good agreement. The linear model was more ‘robust' than the others, especially when experimental data were minimal. The physiological assumptions underlying the linear model are discussed, with particular emphasis on assuring that the model is consistent with bacterial behavior both as individual cells and as populations. It is proposed that the transitional behavior of bacteria at the end of the lag phase can be explained on the basis of biological variability.},

abstract = {The identifiability properties of the Baranyi model for bacterial growth were investigated, both structurally and applied to real-life data. Using the Taylor-series approach, it was formally proven that the model is structurally identifiable, i.e. it is now ascertained that it is certainly possible to give unique values to all parameters of the model, provided the bacterial growth data are of sufficiently good quality. The model also has acceptable practical identifiability properties in the presence of realistic data, which means that the confidence intervals on the parameter values are reasonable. However, there was a relatively high correlation between the maximum specific growth rate μmaxand the suitability indicator h0. An optimal experimental design to improve parameter estimation uncertainty was worked out, using the sampling times of the microbial growth curve as experimental degree of freedom. Using a D-optimal design criterion, it could be shown that the optimal sampling times were concentrated in four time periods (initial, start and end of exponential growth, end of experiment), each providing maximum information on a particular parameter. Because the optimal experimental design requires a priori estimates of the parameters, the propagation of the parameter uncertainty into the experimental design was assessed with a Monte Carlo simulation. In this way, 95% confidence intervals could be established around the optimal sampling times to be used in the optimal experiment. Based on these intervals, a design was proposed and experimentally validated. The error on the parameter estimates was more than halved, their correlation diminished and the nonlinearity of the result improved.},
